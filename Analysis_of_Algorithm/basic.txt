Direct way to find and compare growths

1. Ignore lower order terms.
2. Ignore leading terms constant.

Examples: f(n) = 2n^2 + n + 6  => order of growth: n^2
          g(n) = 10n + 3  => order of growth: n


 How do we compare terms ?

 C < loglog n < log n < n^1/3 < n^1/2 < n < n^2 < n^3 < n^4 < 2^n < n^n
